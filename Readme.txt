Takes:

1- There was a issue of Circular Depdency which was solved by introducing Interface
2- I wasnt compiling all the files due to which there was a compile time error so I used the following command
    g++ OnlineShoppingCart.cpp Cart.cpp Order.cpp Product.cpp Customer.cpp -o OnlineShoppingCart     
    and it started running
